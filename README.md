## 🏗️ Featured Engineering Projects

### 🛡️ [Autonomous Industrial Safety Monitor](https://github.com/RSohaily/Autonomous-industrial-safety-monitor)
Industrial AI | Computer Vision | FastAPI | React
* The Problem: Manual safety monitoring in warehouses is prone to human error and high risk.
* The Solution: Developed an end-to-end Computer Vision system that detects hazards in real-time using Vision Transformers.
* Key Achievement: Engineered a custom risk-stratification logic to prioritize alerts and a historical audit system for industrial compliance.

### ☀️ [Decentralized Microgrid Market](https://github.com/RSohaily/decentralized-microgrid-market)
Energy Informatics | Multi-Agent Systems | Python
* The Problem: Current energy grids are centralized and inefficient for renewable integration.
* The Solution: Created a P2P energy trading simulation where 25 autonomous agents trade solar power based on real-time weather data.
* Key Achievement: Integrated live GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) data from Reutlingen, Germany, to simulate a realistic physics-based energy economy.
